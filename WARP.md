## Project Status

This is a new project with minimal structure. As the codebase develops, this file should be updated with:

- Test execution commands
- Code architecture and patterns
- Development workflow specifics

## Development Commands

TBD - Add build, test, lint, and run commands once the project stack is established.

## Code Architecture

TBD - Document the high-level architecture once core components are implemented.

## Important Notes

- Check the `.gitignore` for excluded files including dependencies, environment variables, build outputs, and IDE configurations
- This project is in early stages - consult with the team on architecture decisions before implementing major features
